# Bringing Compound Expressions to Koltin
This repo is dedicated to the unversity thesis project **Bringing Compound Expressions to Kotlin**.
In this repository I posted, as well as a file with a certain set of ideas, some of which were not considered:
* [Proposal] (https://github.com/nekitivlev/CompoundExpressions/blob/main/CompoundExpressionsProposal.md)
* [Some ideas and examples] (https://github.com/nekitivlev/CompoundExpressions/blob/main/CompoundExpressions.md)
